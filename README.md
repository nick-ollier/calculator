### Notes

I had a great time on this project - Thank you for spending the time to look over it!

#### Framework:

-   I used [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/), and the project was bootstrapped with `npx create-next-app`
    -   Next was probably a bit overkill for the app given it's only a single-page application, however it's always a lot of fun to work with! If I had more time, and budget, it would have been nice to have stored the calculator history outside of local storage and utilised Next.js' SSR capabilities, and used something like [**Axios**](https://axios-http.com/) to handle the requests.

#### Language:

-   For this project I decided to use [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I've only been working with TypeScript for the last few months, but it's safe to say once the confusion, and muscle memory started to disappear I really started enjoying it! It's probably a little rough around the edges in some areas, but the project was a great learning experience, which is what I enjoyed most about doing it!

#### Functional:

-   I started off using my own operators, but then came across [**mathjs**](https://mathjs.org/) which made everything a lot easier ([and safer!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!))

#### Styling:

-   I was a little torn when it came to styling. I love [**Styled Components**](https://styled-components.com/), but have really wanted to use [**tailwindcss**](https://tailwindcss.com/) in a personal project for quite some time... So I used both, and I think it turned out great! In reality, I'd choose one... Just don't ask me which!!

#### Testing:

-   I had a lot of fun testing this project (Hopefully the 100% coverage shows that!). For unit testing I used [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) and [**React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). And for E2E testing I went with [**Cypress**](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) which is relatively new string to my bow!!

#### Extra Credit:

-   **Be Responsive** - So I _cheated <sub>(but not really)</sub>_ a little on this one. I opted for a nice iPhone overlay that supports portrait and landscape views. Realistically, it'd be really easy to take that out and use tailwindcss' [breakpoint prefixes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) instead.
-   **History** - I used local storage to save the calculator history. This is stored and retrieved via a custom useLocalStorage hook. As I mentioned above, it would have been nice to utilise Next.js' SSR capabilities and Axios to fetch/post/delete the history data.

#### Extra Extra Credit:

-   **Built & Deployed** - on the Vercel platform [here](https://calculator-sandy-psi.vercel.app/)!
-   **Dark Mode** - Does what it says on the tin - It's becoming a highly sought after feature, so thought I'd give it a bash myself!
-   **ðŸš§ Component Library ðŸš§** - I created a custom calculator [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/) component library to display each of the components individually! (There's currently an issue around resolving modules causing Storybook not to open properly - I'll get this fixed asap!)
-   **Keyboard Controllable** - Supported keys below!
